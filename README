INSTALLATION

  - Copy index.php to the installation directory.

  - Edit the $cache_dir variable on the script to configure the
    directory where store cache contents.

  - Set enough permissions to the cache directory you have configured
    in order to allow the script to create and read files.


CONFIGURATION
  
  If you need to restrict the installation directory from being
  accessed directly by browsers.

  - Copy dot.htaccess to the installation directory and rename the file
    to .htaccess or the one used by your server's configuration.

  - Edit the .htaccess file to fit your needs. For example, you'll want
    to change the path to AuthUserFile, or something that fits better
    your needs.
